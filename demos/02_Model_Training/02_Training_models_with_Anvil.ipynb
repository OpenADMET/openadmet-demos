    "# 2.1 Training models with Anvil\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Anvil is our primary infrastructure for model training and evaluation, built to support scalable, reproducible, and rigorous development of ADMET prediction models. Recognizing that building the best models requires training many variants, ensuring their reproducibility, and enabling robust performance comparisons, Anvil centers around a YAML-based recipe system. These recipes allow users to specify model architectures and training procedures in a standardized, shareable format—minimizing code duplication while supporting both deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Designed with both internal and external engagement in mind, Anvil aims to lower the barrier for outside users to adopt and fine-tune models by offering simple, transparent workflows. Long-term, it will serve as a foundation for broader community involvement and model reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "To run Anvil, you need:\n",
    "1. A dataset that has been processed with `1.1_Curating_external_datasets.ipynb`.  \n",
    "2. A `YAML` file with instructions for Anvil. We will show you how to create this file in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through how to run the Anvil model training workflow with human pregnane X receptor (PXR) data processed and cleaned in previous notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Creating the YAML file\n",
    "The heart of an anvil run is in its `YAML` configuration file. Here we specify nearly everything needed to:\n",
    "- load data\n",
    "- preprocess it\n",
    "- split the data appropriately into train/validation/test\n",
    "- featurize according to model selection\n",
    "- train the model\n",
    "- and, finally, validate on the test set (which generates performance metrics and plots)  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will walkthrough two `YAML` files: one for training a traditional machine learning model (`2.1_anvil_lgbm.yaml`) and one for training a deep learning model (`2.1_anvil_chemprop.yaml`)."
